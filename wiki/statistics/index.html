<p>Measures the <em>average</em> distance your data values are from the mean.
It's also \sqrt{variance}.</p>
<p>Closely grouped data has a large standard deviation and the opposite for spread out data.</p>
<p>It is:</p>

<p>In sample standard deviation we do /n-1/ to <em>overestimate</em> the variation
because /-1/ decreases the denominator making the result, s, bigger.</p>
<p>Simpler formula:</p>
<script type="math/tex;mode=display">s = \sqrt\frac{n\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1} x_i^2 - (\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1} x_i)^2} {n(n-1)} \\</script>

<script type="math/tex;mode=display">\sigma = \sqrt\frac{\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}(x_i-\mu)^2}{N}</script>
<p>We don't divide by n-1 but N because we don't want to overestimate our population.</p>
<h2 id="empirical-rule">Empirical rule</h2>
<p>How much proportion or percentage of a dataset will fall within certain std devs from the mean.
Applies only to a <em>normally</em> distributed dataset.
Also called 68%, 95%, 99.7% rule. \
If data is normally distributed then:</p>
<ul>
<li>68% of data will fall within 1 standard deviation from the mean</li>
<li>95% of data will fall within 2 standard deviation from the mean</li>
<li>99.7% of data will fall within 3 standard deviation from the mean</li>
</ul>
<p>Data values /within/ 2 standard deviations are <em>usual</em>.
Data values /outside/ 2 standard deviations are <em>unusual</em>.
A data value outside of 3 standard deviations from the mean is extremely rare.</p>
<p>Given different standard deviations (with different units, values, samples etc), we have to find a way to represent what has more spread.
To do this we use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coefficient of variation :: translates s in comparison to \bar x as a percentage</li>
</ul>
<script type="math/tex;mode=display">c.v. = \frac{s}{\bar x} * 100</script>
<ul>
<li>Z score :: The number of standard deviations away from the mean that a data value lies in. This lets to compare two datasets directly to see which has more variation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sampling-distribution-of-sample-mean">Sampling distribution of sample mean</h2>
<p>When we take many samples of the same size from a <em>population</em> and find the sample means \bar x.
The means of those samples follow a normal curve when placed in their own distribution.</p>
<h2 id="sampling-distribution-of-sample-variance">Sampling distribution of sample variance</h2>
<p>When we take many samples of the same size from a <em>normal population</em> and then fine those sample variances s^2, those sample variances don't follow a normal curve when placed in their own distribution.</p>
<p>They follow the chi-square \chi^2 distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom.</p>
<h2 id="chi-squared-distribution">Chi Squared distribution</h2>
<p>Compares sample variance to pop variance.
We try to estimate population variance</p>
<script type="math/tex;mode=display">\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1) s^2}{\sigma^2}</script>
<ul>
<li>n :: sample size</li>
<li><script type="math/tex">s^2</script> :: sample variance
</li>
<li><script type="math/tex">\sigma^2</script> :: population variance
</li>
</ul>
<p>A \chi^2 distribution has a tail to the right.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not symmetrical</li>
<li>Values are non negative -  No 0 in the middle because std and variance can't be 0</li>
<li>As degrees of freedom go up the distribution becomes more symmetrical</li>
<li>Gives critical values for the area to the <em>right</em> - Based on area to the right</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-the-chi-square-distribution">Anatomy of the chi-square distribution</h3>
<ol>
<li>There is no one chi distribution</li>
<li>Area (probability) under the curve is 1</li>
<li>The curve is asymptotic; never touches the x axis</li>
<li>1 is at the left and 0 is at the right</li>
<li>Cumulative probability runs right to left</li>
<li>Probabilities are found in the chi-square table in the same manner as normal curves</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
<p>Given n = 12 and confidence level = 95%. Find the critical value which make the <script type="math/tex">\chi^2</script> distribution.</p>
<p><em>Solution</em></p>
<script type="math/tex;mode=display">\alpha = 1-0.95 = 0.05 \\

\dfrac{0.05}{2} = 0.025\\

From the table:\\
Using\ 0.025\ as\ P:\ Area\ to\ the\ right \chi^2 critical\ value = 21.29\\

Using\ 0.975\ as\ P:\ Area\ to\ the\ left \chi^2 critical\ value = 3.816</script>
<p>Because we try to estimate pop variance then</p>
<script type="math/tex;mode=display">\chi^2 = \frac{(n-1) s^2}{\sigma^2}
\rightarrow
\sigma^2= \frac{(n-1) s^2}{\chi^2}</script>
<p>We have two  <script type="math/tex">\chi^2</script> values A <script type="math/tex">\chi^2_{left}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\chi^2_{right}</script>.</p>
<p>From above it's <script type="math/tex">\chi^2_{left} = 3.816  \chi^2_{right} = 21.29</script>.</p>
<p>The <script type="math/tex">\chi^2_{right}</script> is larger therefore when <script type="math/tex">(n-1)s^2</script> is divided by it, we get a smaller value. Therefore:</p>
<p>Variance:</p>
<script type="math/tex">\dfrac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{right}} < \sigma^2 <  \dfrac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{left}}</script>
<p>Standard deviation:</p>
<script type="math/tex">\sqrt{\dfrac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{right}}} < \sigma < \sqrt{\dfrac{(n-1)s^2}{\chi^2_{left}}}</script>
<p>The <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> and confidence level are complimentary</p>
<p>This says our pop variance lies within this range with 95% certainty</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
<p>We sample 10 phone chargers and we have a std dev of 0.15 volts.

Populations can be large, it's hard to collect data on each member of a population.</p>
<p>Collecting data on all members of a population is called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census][census]].</p>
<h2 id="sample-data">Sample data</h2>
<p>When we need to make a conclusion about our population we use a sample.
A small but well chosen sample can accurately represent the population.</p>
<p>Sample guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>All elements in the sample should be part of the population</li>
<li>The sample should be representative of the population</li>
<li>In most cases (if not all) samples from the population should be independent of each other</li>
</ul>
<p>Kinds of samples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Random</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample is always an approximation of the population. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample data sets always have error built into them</li>

<ul>
<li>\alpha is the complement of the confidence level.</li>
<li>most common confidence levels:
<ul>
<li>90% \rightarrow \alpha = 0.1</li>
<li>95% (most used) \rightarrow \alpha = 0.05</li>
<li>99% \rightarrow \alpha = 0.01</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Measure of <em>distance</em> from the mean. \
How far from the mean is a is a given data point.
How many <em>standard deviations</em> away (above or below) from the mean is a data point.
Standard deviation here is a unit of measurement like a kg, meter etc.</p>
<p>z-scores are standardized measures where the unit is a standard deviations.</p>
<p>z score of the mean is 0 because it's zero distance from itself.</p>

<h2 id="odds">Odds</h2>
<p>Odds are probability of something occurring / probability of something not occurring</p>
<p>$$odds = \dfrac{P(occurring)}{P(not\ occurring)}$$</p>
<p>Probability of it not occurring is: 1 - probability of it occurring</p>
<p>$$odds =  \dfrac{p}{q} = \dfrac{p}{1-p}$$</p>
<p>/What about events that have a probability of 1 occurring? We get odds of infinity/</p>

<h2 id="odds-ratio">Odds ratio</h2>
<p>A ratio of two odds
We are comparing the likelihood of getting an outcome in two separate &quot;systems&quot;</p>
<p>If we want to know how much we increase the odds of getting an outcome by changing one variable and holding all others constant.
/odds ratio for a variable show how the odds change with 1 unit increase in that variable holding all other variables constant./
e.g</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the odds of getting a loan approved by increasing your credit score  by 1?</li>
<li>What are the odds of getting  a heart attack when you increase your bodyweight 1 kg past a certain threshold?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="examples-1">Examples</h4>
<p>Say we want to start a casino and want to make some loaded coins to make sure the house wins.
We may want to know how to load our coin so that the house wins but the players also win a few times to keep them coming.
We want to know how many more times our loaded coin will get a certain outcome compares to a fair coin.</p>
<h6 id="a-loaded-coin">A loaded coin</h6>
<p>P(heads) = \dfrac{7}{10} = 0.7 \
odds(heads) = \dfrac{0.7}{0.3} = 2.333</p>
<h6 id="a-fair-coin">A fair coin</h6>
<p>P(heads) = \dfrac{1}{2} = 0.5 \
odds(heads) = \dfrac{0.5}{0.5} = 1.0</p>
<p>Odds ratio would be:
\dfrac{2.333}{1.0} = 2.333</p>
<p>This means that in the loaded coin we are 2.333 more times likely to get heads than on the fair coin.
Loading the coin by 2 increases the odds of getting a heads by 2.333</p>
<h2 id="odds-ratio-in-logistic-regression">Odds ratio in logistic regression</h2>
<p>The odds ratio for a variable in logistic regression represents how the odds change with 1 unit increase in that variable holding all other variables constant.</p>
<h3 id="example-4">Example</h3>
<p>By increasing our credit score by one how do we affect the probability of getting a loan approved?</p>
<p>Body weight and sleep apnea. Categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>apnea</li>
<li>no apnea</li>
</ul>
<p>Weight variable has an odds ratio of 1.07</p>
<p>This means a 1 pound increase in body weight increase the odds of having sleep apnea by 1.07.\
A 10 lbs increase in weight increase the odds to 1.98.\
A 20 lbs increase raised odds to 3.87.</p>
<h2 id="odds-vs-probability">Odds vs probability</h2>
<p>One could have high odds but still low probability for something.
You may increase your odds of something but the probability of getting that outcome was still low to begin with.
Another may have lower odds but high probability of getting an outcome.</p>
<p>Take the case of people in different ages on different diets and on different drugs and their chances of them getting sick because of it. Younger people have a low probability of getting sick whether or not they do things that increase their odds of getting sick.</p>
<p>Odds can have a large magnitude change even if the underlying probabilities are low.</p>
<h2 id="logit">Logit</h2>
<p>We don't know p and we wish to estimate it. The estimate of p is written src_LANG[headers]{\hat p} (p hat).
We need a function that links the independent variable x axis with probabilities on the y axis.</p>
<script type="math/tex;mode=display">ln(odds) = ln(\frac{p}{q}) = ln(p) - ln(q) = logit(p)

log_ex = ln\ x</script>
<h2 id="regression-equation">Regression equation</h2>
<p>We are estimating an unknown p for any given linear combo of independent variables.
In the logit function we have 0 to 1 running along our x axis but we want to have them on our y axis.
We can achieve that by taking the inverse of the logit function.</p>
<script type="math/tex;mode=display">logit(p) =  ln(\dfrac{p}{1-p})\\[3mm]

Where p is between 0 and 1\\[2mm]

logit^{-1}(\alpha) = \dfrac{1}{1+e^{-\alpha}} =  \dfrac{e^{\alpha}}{1+e^{\alpha}}\\[3mm]

log_ex = ln\ x\\[2mm]

logit(p) = ln(\dfrac{p}{1-p}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1\\[2mm]

\dfrac{p}{1-p} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1}\\[2mm]

p = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1}(1-p)\\[2mm]

distribute\\[0.5mm]

p = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1} - e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1} * p\\[2mm]

p +  e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1} * p = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1}\\[2mm]

p(1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1}) =  e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1}\\[2mm]

Therefore the estimated regression equation:\\[1mm]

\^p =  \dfrac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1}}{1+ e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1}}</script>
