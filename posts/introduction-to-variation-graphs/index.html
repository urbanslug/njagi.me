            <p>I expect the audience of this post to be both programmers and biologists so I'll
bring you up to speed on a topic before going into it.
Feel free to skip a sentence, paragraph or even section if you're familiar with a topic.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="genome-sequencing">Genome sequencing</h2>
<p>A <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome">genome</a></strong> is the entire genetic code of an organism. While computational data
is  represented in binary form, ones, and zeros, biochemical data is represented
by nitrogenous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)">bases</a> that seem to stick out of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> molecule/strand
abbreviated A, T, C, and G for DNA and A, G, C and U for RNA.
We care about RNA because some viruses have RNA and not
DNA.</p>
<p>If this is confusing, you can think of a strand of DNA or RNA as a thread  with
knots where each knot is a base.</p>
<p>A <strong>sequence</strong> is an <em>ordering</em> of something.
A programming analog is a sequence vs a collection. Sequences are ordered,
for example lists, and therefore have the potential for a <em>next</em> and a <em>previous</em>
element while collections are just data thrown together, for example, a
dictionary or a set.</p>
<p><strong>Genome sequencing</strong> (or sequencing a genome) therefore, is determining the
order of bases in all of the DNA or RNA in an organism. What makes this easy is
that all the cells in an individual organism have the same DNA so we can
get all the DNA in an organism from a single cell.
In practice, however, we can't work with a single cell due to its size.
Ignore chromosomes, haplotypes and other things you may know about DNA for now.</p>
<p>To determine the sequence of bases in an entire genome of an organism we focus
on only one of the alleles (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype">haplotype</a>) and only one strand of the
double helix.
Since 2005 we've used methods broadly categorized
under <strong>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)</strong> to perform genome sequencing.
There are two main ways of performing NGS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shear the DNA into small fragments, sequence those and try to build back the
original sequence. An analogy that’s used is shredding a newspaper article
then trying to recreate it.</li>
<li>Run the DNA strand like a train would run through a tunnel through a pore
and read the sequence of bases.
There are other methods of reading entire strands of DNA but they don't matter
in this context.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you would expect, each method has its drawbacks and advantages.
What we get out of the machine that does the actual sequencing of DNA is called
a read and reads have to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment">aligned</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly">assembled</a><sup>2</sup>.
Alignment involves stacking reads on top of each other and assembling is the
greater process that involves alignment, algorithmically choosing the best
alignment and determining what the original sequence was.</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of assembly<sup>4</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>De-novo assembly:</strong> this is where we sequence a genome that has never been
sequenced before</li>
<li><strong>Mapping assembly:</strong> this is sequencing an organism’s unique code despite
having the general sequence for the species. What you get from services
like <a href="https://www.23andme.com/en-int/">23andMe</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-reference-genome">The reference genome</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_genome">reference genome</a> is a consensus sequence that accepted as the genome of a
species<sup>2</sup>. It’s stored as one long sequence of characters/bases.
You may wonder how we can have a known genome of an entire species when every
individual has a unique genetic code or how <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tiny-genetic-differences-between-humans-and-other-primates-pervade-the-genome/">humans are 99% chimp</a>.
Well, the answer is that genetic code of most organisms
is similar and this similarity increases as we narrow down taxonomically.
When we say that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tiny-genetic-differences-between-humans-and-other-primates-pervade-the-genome/">a human is closer to a chimp than a monkey</a> what we mean is
that we can observe greater variation between the genomes of the two, man+chimp vs monkey, than man vs chimp alone.</p>
<p>This isn't actual math but may help clear things up.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#002b36;color:#839496;"><code><span>variation(combine_genomes(man, chimp), monkey) &gt; variation(man, chimp)
</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<h1 id="variation-in-genomes">Variation in genomes</h1>
<p>However, there are still genomic differences and they should not be ignored.
<em>The ignoring of differences is implicit in a linear reference.</em>
A better way to describe them is to say that the differences are segregating within the population.
We may also want to carry out a comparison between species or between related
species which is done in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-genome">pangenomics</a>.</p>
<p>DNA has sections which are identical between individuals (conserved regions), and
the number of these  sections grow as we narrow down taxonomically and there are
sections which vary between individuals, for example, the short sequence repeats
that are compared in paternity testing.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph theory</a> is an area in math that can help us understand variable
regions within genomes. The idea of representing genomes as graphs isn’t new,
however, the low number of tools like <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/vg">vg</a> which apply graph theory to genomics
and the little that we know about genomes has been a drawback.</p>
<h1 id="graphs">Graphs</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph</a> is a series of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges.
<img src="/images/Content/Graphs/all_graphs.png" alt="all graphs" /></p>
<p>For genome graphs, we focus on directed acyclic graphs.
A <strong>walk</strong> in a directed graph is traversal from one node to another through an
edge, for example, <em>a</em> to <em>b</em> to <em>d</em> or <em>a</em> to <em>c</em> to <em>d</em>.
<img src="/images/Content/Graphs/directed_graph.png" alt="directed graph" /></p>
<h1 id="the-current-state-of-affairs">The current state of affairs</h1>
<p>Once the reference genome of an organism has been determined, it is stored in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format">fasta format</a> which contains the sequence and metadata. Moving forward, anyone
sequencing the same species aligns against this reference. Differences that occur
in less than 1% of the reads are usually thrown out;
the ones that aren’t thrown out don’t help to update the reference but are stored
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format">Variant Call Format (VCF)</a> which contains the variation data and their
positions plus metadata. These VCF files are spread out amongst researchers and
aid in the particular thing being researched but generally don’t contribute in
and of themselves to the general genomic body of knowledge.
However, every once in awhile the reference is updated but not on a fixed
schedule<sup>2</sup>.
It’s for this reason that the variation graph would be a good way of
representing the reference. There is research that confirmed that short
reads align better to the variation graph than to a linear reference<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<h1 id="graphs-and-genomes">Graphs and genomes</h1>
<p>Graphs that are applied to genomes are generally called <strong>genome graphs</strong>.
However, there are two more specific categories which are sequence graphs and
variation graphs.</p>
<p>As an example assume that we zoom on a hypothetical reference: <strong>&quot;ACTGAATTTGTA&quot;</strong></p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Variation</th><th align="center">Position</th><th align="center">Alternative</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td align="center">Variation1</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">GGGA</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">Variation2</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">C</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>We could recursively insert Variation1 at position 2 and Variation2 at position
4 to generate the graph below:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Content/Graphs/example.png" alt="sequence graph" />
(generated using <a href="https://github.com/urbanslug/graphite">graphite</a> and <a href="https://github.com/urbanslug/graph">my current fork of graph</a>)</p>
<p>In this case, a single walk would represent a possible genome. Compared to the
reference, this variation information is maintained and the graph still holds
the data that was in reference.</p>
<h2 id="sequence-graphs">Sequence Graphs</h2>
<p>These are graphs with sequence labels on the nodes or edges.</p>
<p>Sequence graphs or equivalent structures have been used previously to represent
multiple sequences that contain shared differences or ambiguities in a single
structure. Related structures used in genome assembly which collapse long
repeated sequences, so the same nodes are used for different regions of the
genome include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph">De Bruijn graph</a><sup>5</sup>. Graphs to represent genetic variation
have previously been used for microbial genomes &amp; localized regions of the human
genome such as the major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histocompatibility">histocompatibility</a> complex.</p>
<h2 id="variation-graphs">Variation Graphs</h2>
<p>A variation graph is a sequence graph together with a set of paths representing
possible sequences from a population. However, what makes it so unique is it's
tight mapping between the graph and the reference.</p>
<h2 id="variation-graphs-and-rsv">Variation graphs and RSV</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_orthopneumovirus">Human orthopneumovirus</a>, formerly known as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV),
is a single-stranded RNA virus and a good candidate for exploration using the
variation graph because viruses don’t have proofreading in their genetic code.
Proofreading is a process in which the cell ensures that it has copied the
genetic code correctly in preparation for cell division. Without proofreading,
errors will be commonplace leading to high mutation rates.
Another advantage is the size of its genome; the reference stands at
15,206 bases which translate to 15206 bytes or 14.8 KB of memory.</p>
<h1 id="generating-a-variation-graph">Generating a variation graph</h1>
<p>As of writing this, <a href="https://github.com/urbanslug/graphite">graphite</a> can’t generate a graph out of reads alone
(perform an alignment). It supports a reference in fasta and a single VCF file.</p>
<p>I'll detail the algorithm in a <a href="/posts/2019-07-15-Creating-the-Initial-Variation-Graph.html">later post</a> but the gist of it is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load the reference into memory or read a chunk of it if you wish</li>
<li>Load your variation data from a VCF</li>
<li>Organize variations into structs containing
<ul>
<li>variation</li>
<li>position</li>
<li>reference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sort the variations in ascending order by position</li>
<li>Using a right fold function - for support of streams
<ol>
<li>fold through the list of variations</li>
<li>At each variation position split the reference and create a list of:
<ul>
<li>the string to the left</li>
<li>string to the right</li>
<li>a list of the variation and the base that was there originally (this will be a list of lists)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create directed graph out of the list of lists generated by the fold
* <code>'((a b) (a c)) to become a node with edges from a to b and c to be and a-&gt;b and a-&gt;b</code></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="variation">Variation</h2>
<p>A variation is a struct of <code>position</code> and <code>sequence</code>.</p>
<p>I’m using the <a href="https://github.com/stchang/graph">racket graph library graph</a> to generate a graph out of the nested
lists and treating the graph as a “dynamic tree”.</p>
<p>We then rely on graph to generate an unweighted directed graph through
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/graph/index.html#%28def._%28%28lib._graph%2Fmain..rkt%29._unweighted-graph%2Fdirected%29%29">unweighted-graph/directed</a>.
We export the graph in dot format and visualize via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz">graphviz</a>. Serialization isn’t implemented yet.</p>
